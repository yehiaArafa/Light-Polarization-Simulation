# Light-Polarization-Simulation

Understanding and manipulating the polarization of light is important for many optical applications. Polarization, is an important property of light that affects even those optical systems that do not explicitly measure it. This project objective is to analyze systems that have number of polarizer devices where the input is a polarized light source, linearly or circularly and the outputs are the intensity when rotating one of the polarized devices, Jones Matrix of the polarized devices, and the shape of the Polarization Ellipse.
